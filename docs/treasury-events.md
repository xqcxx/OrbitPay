    recipient: Address,   // Address that received the funds
    token: Address,       // Token address that was transferred
    amount: i128,         // Amount of tokens transferred

## Off-Chain Indexing

These events are designed to support efficient off-chain indexing:

1. **Consistent naming** - All events follow a clear naming pattern: `{Action}{Object}`
2. **Structured data** - Each event includes all relevant context for indexing
3. **Transaction linking** - `proposal_id` can be used to link related events (created → approved → executed)
4. **State tracking** - Events include sufficient data to reconstruct contract state
